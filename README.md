Hi, I’m [Your Name], a passionate Full-Stack Developer specializing in .NET, Angular, React, and modern web technologies. I enjoy building scalable applications, micro frontends, APIs, and cloud-ready solutions with clean architecture and performance in mind.

This portfolio showcases some of my work, including:

  Web Applications – CRUD systems, dashboards, and enterprise apps.

  Frontend Projects – Interactive UIs with Angular & React, optimized for performance and user experience.

  Backend APIs – RESTful & GraphQL services using .NET with CQRS, MediatR, and EF Core.

  Micro Frontend Architecture – Seamless integration of Angular and React in distributed systems.

  Personal Projects – Experimenting with creative coding, portfolio design, and automation scripts.

  My focus is on writing clean, reusable, and efficient code, while also delivering user-friendly interfaces.
Outside coding, I’m always exploring new technologies and sharing knowledge through projects, guides, and experiments.
