I enjoy building both the frontend and the backend whether it’s crafting smooth, responsive interfaces with React, Angular, Next.js, SCSS, Tailwind, and Bootstrap, or designing solid backends with .NET, Node.js, Web API, GraphQL and SQL.","For me, coding isn't just about writing lines of code it’s about solving problems and creating experiences that people actually enjoy using. I get excited about projects where I can blend clean design, strong architecture, and real-world impact.","Outside of coding, I enjoy learning new tools, collaborating with others, and finding creative ways to tackle challenges.
